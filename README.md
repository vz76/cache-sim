# Cache Simulator for CS378 Energy Efficient Computing

## Execution

To run in terminal: 
```
chmod +x ./compile.sh ./run.sh && ./run.sh
```

## Overview

Output benchmarks can be found in the `./outputs` folder. At the top of each file, there are summaries of simulation for the three different set associativities, with detailed statistics below. 

Our methodology of tracking metrics is explained further in `./REPORT.pdf`. Reasonable assumptions are made given the original spec which might not conform to the new spec, as allowed in [Ed #151](https://edstem.org/us/courses/54035/discussion/4804452), which may explain some deviances in these metrics.
